### Note:
- **Buy extra** for the hardware listed above. Screws are usually sold in a pack of 25/50/100, so no worries on that.
- The quantity for the rubber tube is not specified, since they are usually sold in meters, and 1 meter will be plenty.
- For the o-ring, diameter don't have to be percise since they are flexible, but don't go too far off. The width matters, because that effects how hard it can grip the filament.
- For the Rubber tube, diameter don't have to be percise since they are flexible, but don't go too far off.
- The box size is for 4-channel build, and try to get the ones without handle, because they conflicts with the filament spool sometimes.
